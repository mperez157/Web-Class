                <h4>Colonialism and Imperialism:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the central themes of the book is the examination of Puerto Rico's status as a colony of the United States. Denis delves into the historical context of Puerto Rico's colonization, including the Spanish-American War and the subsequent transfer of Puerto Rico to U.S. control. The book highlights how Puerto Rico has been treated as a possession rather than a fully autonomous nation, subject to exploitation and domination by external powers.</li>

            <div class="column">

                <ul>
                    <li>Another key theme of the book is the resistance of the Puerto Rican people against colonial rule. Denis documents various episodes of resistance throughout Puerto Rico's history, including nationalist uprisings, labor strikes, and political activism. The book underscores the resilience and determination of Puerto Ricans in their struggle for self-determination and social justice, despite facing repression and violence from colonial authorities.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tactics of state violence and repression used by U.S. authorities to maintain control over Puerto Rico. Denis exposes the brutality of law enforcement agencies, such as the infamous police chief Winship, who employed repressive measures to crush dissent and maintain order on the island. The book documents political persecution, censorship, and extrajudicial killings aimed at suppressing Puerto Rican nationalism and dissent.</li>
                </ul>
