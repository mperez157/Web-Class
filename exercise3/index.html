      A Handmade Web

    <p class="card-text">Carpenter shows online existence to readers to reconsider the artfully created and deeply human web through personal stories and poetic prose. I find website design to be the most creative thing that I have done and to learn how to code in this class is a new artform I am learning.</p>

    <p class="card-text">A website is what you make it as long as it appeals to the user as well, your website is your artwork. Schwulst emphasizes that the web progresses with us as time goes. You can have anxiety about what you are creating but in the end it will grow as you grow, as society grows. Everything is constantly changing.</p>

     A Rant on Technology
     </span>
    </header>
    <p class="card-text">Technology is much more than most people think. For me, when I hear the word technology in today's age I of course, like most others, think of computers. However, Le Guin has reminded me that technology is every material thing that we interact with. How fascinating? Now everything seems like art to me.</p>
