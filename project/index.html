            <p>In 1950, Puerto Rico's Nationalist Party, led by Pedro Albizu Campos, launched a failed armed revolt against US colonial rule. The uprising resulted in widespread violence, including assassination attempts on President Harry Truman and US Army bombings of two towns. Nelson A. Denis's "War Against All Puerto Ricans" meticulously details these events, intertwining Albizu Campos's story with Puerto Rico's broader struggle for self-determination from 1898 to the present day.</p>

            <h4>Violence and Repression</h4>
            <p>Tactics of state violence and repression used by U.S. authorities to maintain control over Puerto Rico is exposed by the brutality of law enforcement agencies, such as the infamous police chief Winship, who employed repressive measures to crush dissent and maintain order on the island.
