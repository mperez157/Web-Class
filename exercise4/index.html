    <h2>Don't Judge a Bicycle by it's Bear</h2>
    <p>Not everything is what it seems. <br> A website can be fancy and beautiful yet unrealistic and broken. <br> Never judge a bicycle by it's bear.</p>
    <h4>"I believe every material has a grain, including the web. But this assumption flies in the face of our expectations for technology. Too often, the internet is cast as a wide-open, infinitely malleable material. We expect technology to help us overcome limitations, not produce more of them. In spite of those promises, we typically yield consistent design results."</h4>

    <p>I love polaroids and anything film. I just wanted to add this in here. <br> I love the redundancy.</p>

    <p>So cool I want this printed in my room. At this point all I can focus on in this article is the media.</p>

    <p>I love seeing how it went from polaroids to regular photos with overlaps. I really appreciate when websites don't use everything aligned a certain way and become creative with positioning.</p>

    <p>Here I am. At the end. Pretty confused. Obsessed with the media and the presentation. But, I don't feel like I learned much because I was too focused on trying to understand and not actually understanding. <br> That is okay. I enjoyed the reading!</p>
